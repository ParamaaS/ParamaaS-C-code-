I never used Github before but I would  like to upload my C++ code.

The code cover various topics of competitive programming including very basic topics to complicate data structure and algorithm.

I would like to contribute to Thailand Competitive Programmming society with my code.
I will further organize and upload the additional information for whom would like to be succesful in competitive programming.
