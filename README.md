I have never used Github before but I would like to upload my C++ code.

The code cover various topics of competitive programming including very basic topics to complicate data structure and algorithm.

I would like to contribute to Thailand Competitive Programmming society with my code.

I will further organize and upload the additional information for whom would like to be succesful in competitive programming even I don't think I am the smartest guy in this area  but would like to pay it forward to the society.

Wish you have fun with my code.
